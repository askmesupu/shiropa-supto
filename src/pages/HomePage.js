        Our story began in 2023, the moment I first laid eyes on Shiropa. From that day, I whispered
        heartfelt prayers to the universe, hoping that fate would unite us. Time passed, and
        with patience and faith, our hearts intertwined. Finally, after the beautiful celebration of
        Durga Puja, on the 20th of October 2025, our love blossomed fully, and we officially
        became a couple. Every moment since then has been a precious journey of love, laughter,
        and endless dreams together.
